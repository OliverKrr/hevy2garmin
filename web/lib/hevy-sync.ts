/**
 * Hevy READ wrappers — the SAFE half of the sync engine.
 *
 * This module ONLY reads from the Hevy API (workout count + full workout list).
 * It never writes to Hevy, never touches Garmin, and never uploads a FIT. The
 * upload half of the pipeline (generateFit / uploadFit / rename / delete) lives
 * elsewhere and is deliberately excluded here — a bad Garmin upload creates a
 * duplicate Garmin/Strava activity, a hard user constraint, so the read side is
 * kept isolated and testable.
 *
 * The Hevy API key is resolved (in order):
 *   1. the `key` argument, if given;
 *   2. process.env.HEVY_API_KEY;
 *   3. the `platform_credentials` row where platform='hevy' (credentials.api_key),
 *      matching how the Python config.py resolves it.
