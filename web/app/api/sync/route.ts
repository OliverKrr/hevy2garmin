/**
 * POST /api/sync  —  batch sync of ALL candidates. DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT.
 *
 * Mirrors the Python dashboard's /api/sync:
 *   - dry-run (default): reports how many workouts WOULD sync, plus a preview of
 *     the next one — no upload, no DB write.
 *   - live (requires ?live=1 AND authorization): if GITHUB_PAT + GITHUB_REPO are
 *     set, triggers the sync GitHub Action via repository_dispatch (the deployed
 *     path — avoids the Vercel function timeout + browser-auth constraints);
 *     otherwise loops the tested single-workout engine (syncOneWorkout) up to a
 *     safety cap, aggregating the per-workout results.
 *
 * A live upload fires only when BOTH the request asks for it (?live=1 / body
 * {live}) AND is authorized (h2g session cookie OR Bearer CRON_SECRET) — the
 * same gate as /api/sync-one.
